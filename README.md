angular-php-signup
==================

Experimenting with AngularJS and a PHP backend.
I'm on a motorcycle mailing list that does a yearly meetup (list members are spread over the world but mostly in Europe).
Since I'm maintaining the - very minimal - website I also get to do a sign up form for these meetings.
This repo contains my first attempt to do it with AngularJS talking to a PHP backend.
Since it's all kept very simple there is no database, just a CSV file for back-end storage.

There is no frontend and very minimal backend validation, still to do: ~~showing error messages in the front end,
clearing the form upon successful submit~~.
